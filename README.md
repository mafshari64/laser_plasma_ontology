The first version of laser-plasma ontology can be found in a folder with that name. The ontology is provided by [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)  which is one of the most famous and well-established software for ontology creation. The ontology is saved in RDF/XML format which is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard for representing RDF (Resource Description Framework) data and is widely adopted in the semantic web community.
RDF stands for Resource Description Framework. It is a standard model for representing data and metadata on the web. RDF provides a framework for expressing relationships between resources in a machine-readable format, enabling data interchange and integration across different applications and systems.
Some software such as [WebVOWL](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/) are easy to understand and to be used even by "non-ontologists" to view the structure of ontology online in a web browser without specific expertise. We need to export the ontology and WebVOWL will present the structure of the ontology.
